    "1.  Please visit this link to access the state-of-art DenseNet code for reference - DenseNet - cifar10 notebook link\n",
    "2.  You need to create a copy of this and \"retrain\" this model to achieve 90+ test accuracy. \n",
    "3.  You cannot use Dense Layers (also called fully connected layers), or DropOut.\n",
    "4.  You MUST use Image Augmentation Techniques.\n",
    "5.  You cannot use an already trained model as a beginning points, you have to initilize as your own\n",
    "6.  You cannot run the program for more than 300 Epochs, and it should be clear from your log, that you have only used 300 Epochs\n",
    "7.  You cannot use test images for training the model.\n",
    "8.  You cannot change the general architecture of DenseNet (which means you must use Dense Block, Transition and Output blocks as mentioned in the code)\n",
    "9.  You are free to change Convolution types (e.g. from 3x3 normal convolution to Depthwise Separable, etc)\n",
    "10. You cannot have more than 1 Million parameters in total\n",
    "11. You are free to move the code from Keras to Tensorflow, Pytorch, MXNET etc. \n",
    "12. You can use any optimization algorithm you need. \n",
    "13. You can checkpoint your model and retrain the model from that checkpoint so that no need of training the model from first if you lost at any epoch while training. You can directly load that model and Train from that epoch. "
